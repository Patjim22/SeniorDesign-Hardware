# Hardware-Design

Each folder should contain two files:

- The first is a .zip file contains all of the Gerber Output files needed to print the PCB
- The other file is a .step file for the 3D model of the PCB
- There are other 3D CAD files in the final revision(s) as well as Bill Of Materials (BOM) Documents.


Note: Fusion 360 does not support GitHub, but has its own version control platform called Fusion Teams. 
All files and revision data has been shared with Dr.Rachana Gupta, Jeremy Edmondson, Dan Green, Dzung nyguen, and all team members. 
The final versions of each PCB revision have been included here, but little to no iterative commits will be seen for the aboove reasons. 

See Fuson Teams for version control and Google drive for other related files. View the Manual Document for further instructions. 
Thank you, Hunter Marlette
